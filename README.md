BVI-SVQA is a software that allows people to prepare and perform experiments for **S**ubjective **V**ideo **Q**uality **A**ssessment. BVI-SVQA was developed at the University of Bristol as part of a final year project of Mr G. Dimitrov under the supervision of Dr A. Katsenou and Prof. D. R. Bull.

# Requirements

* Operating system: Windows, Linux or macOS
* Python 3.5
    - Windows: you can download the Python 3.5 distribution from the official [website.](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-354rc1/) 
    - Linux: `sudo add-apt-repository ppa:deadsnakes/ppa` `sudo apt-get update` `sudo apt-get install python3.5`
    - macOS: `https://www.python.org/downloads/mac-osx/`
    - Run the following command from the folder where requirements.txt is located to install the necessary python libraries - `pip install -r requirements.txt`
* NodeJS
    - It can be downloaded and installed from `https://nodejs.org/en/` for all platforms
* ElectronJS
    - Run the following command to install electron globally - `npm install -g electron`
* FFMPEG
    - Windows: provided with the application repository and no extra steps are required.
    - Linux: you can install it using the following three commands:
       - `sudo add-apt-repository universe`
       - `sudo apt update`
       - `sudo apt install ffmpeg`
    - macOS: The simplest way to install ffmpeg on Mac OS X is with [Homebrew](http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/). Once you have Homebrew                installed install ffmpeg from the Terminal with the following: `brew install ffmpeg`.
 * MPV player
    - Windows: provided with the application repository and no extra steps are required.
    - Linux: install it via `sudo apt-get install mpv`
    - macOS: install it by using [Homebrew]: `brew install mpv`
 * VMAF
    - Windows: provided with the application repository and no extra steps are required.
    - Linux: Instructions for installation of **vmafossexec** available on the Netflix vmaf [repository.](https://github.com/Netflix/vmaf/blob/master/resource/doc/vmafossexec.md)
    - macOS: SHOULD BE SAME AS LINUX. NOT YET TESTED!
     - Final  step for Linux and macOS. 
        - After completing the instructions given in the link above, move the wrapper folder into the vmaf folder in the BVI-SVQA software.
